                  On his latest trip to North Idaho from October 6th-8th, James Vandermaas met with the Kootenai County Democrat Candidate Recruitment and Support Committee to introduce himself and listen to what Kootenai Democrats are concerned with. Some of the Democrats in attendance included Paula Niels, the Chair of the Kootenai Democrat Central Committee, Richard Rolland, the Vice Chair of the KCDCC, Christopher Matthews, the Chair of the Candidate Recruitment Committee, and Shem Hanks, the President of the Kootenai Democratic Club. James showed genuine knowledge and a precise plan for what he would do if elected in areas of Education, Business Relations, Healthcare, and an ingenious idea of factoring in cost of living factors to better adjust the livable wage for specific communities. James was asked about DACA and the committee was very pleased with his support of these young productive members of our county, who have put themselves out there. When asked how he would respond to moderate and progressive Democrats, Mr. Vandermaas illustrated his plan for a ‘Coalition of Democracy” to bring everyone together to give all Idahoans in Congressional District 1 a voice, one unified voice regardless of whether you are conservative, progressive, Republican, Democrat, or anything in between. James left the meeting with more support and greater excitement in the prospect of a competent, well-organized, and decisive Democrat running for Congress. A serious contender for a serious seat. The committee was very impressed with the ease and knowledge James was able to show when he answered questions on the fly, showing his genuine and decisive nature. The Committee felt confidant that James Vandermaas could bring together Idahoans regardless of party. On Saturday James and Cindy attended “Disco Inferno 2017: 80’s Dance Explosion": the fourth annual benefit for Coeur d’Alene School District 271 school libraries, taking the night to support our Schools.<br>

                  Sponsored by the Ada County Democrats, this was fundraiser and wonderful social event. Our friend Sam Sandmire did a great job as emcee, and the keynote speaker, Cook County Commissioner Bridget Gainer, gave quite a relevant talk.  Between good friends, good food, and winning one of the silent auction gift baskets, James & Cindy had a great night!
