                <p>We ALL have a right to affordable and cost-effective healthcare - it can be a reality. We can strengthen and expand Medicare in phases, covering more people while lowering costs. We can stabilize the market by fixing the current laws, have Congress actually pay what they promised, then reduce more costs by repealing the Republican's prescription law that forces us to pay full price, then allowing Medicare to negotiate down drug prices and other services.</p>

               <l>
                  <li>Fix the flaws in the existing law to keep all insured and providers solvent</li>
                  <li>Continue 're-insurance' subsidies to keep providers on the exchanges and prices down</li>

                  <li>Creating a healthcare system that works for us ALL - "Consolidated-Medicare".</li>

         <p> Our current Medicare is the perfect model to start from, and through a 'phase in over time' approach, we can make it work for all of us. This approach is far more affordable for all, including the taxpayers, and shows that cost-effective healthcare can be a reality.  Don’t be fooled or believe the lies of those who say we’re copying other countries 'socialized medicine' or 'waiting in long lines'- which we already do! And definitely don't listen to those who don’t believe that healthcare is a right; Our 'right to life' in this country is a right to a healthy life!  ‘Consolidated-Medicare’ is and will always be uniquely American, and will save lives and tax dollars! So please do not be fooled by those few greedy rich people at the top 1% who are trying to get more, but at our expense; the Republican healthcare plan gives them a tax cut and more wealth, and we loose our healthcare because we can't afford what's left, and yes, many may die from a lack of healthcare...
<div>  Something uniquely American is our compassion and humanity for our fellow man, our natural urge to help others, and they are trying take that away from us - to make us angry that others who are in need or less fortunate, to destroy our humanity - This we must fight with everything that we are! </div></p>
              <div>
              <p>Medicare is very functional, affordable, respected, and creating "Consolidated-Medicare" makes it work for all of us.</p>

                <p>Idaho is NOT for sale! Keep public lands public and protected, accessible for hunting, recreation, and your enjoyment. Idaho state government cannot afford to maintain and protect these these lands like the Federal government does for us; they already know this, and would have to sell our lands - then they would be inaccessible and gone forever - We cannot let this happen!</p>

                <p>Many Republicans try to convince us our federal public lands are a "states rights" issue, and that we need to return them to state control – as though we can do it better - this makes absolutely NO sense... Idaho just doesn't have the money!  So why take on this additional cost and responsibility when the federal government is paying a bill Idaho can’t afford? Because many rich and special business interests want our lands for the profit they can make!</p>
                 <li>The Federal government owns and pays to manage 32,621,631 acres in Idaho, which is 61.6% of the land in our state, caring for and maintaining the land that we enjoy.</li>
                  <li>  A recent study reveals Idaho would experience up to a $250 million deficit if Idaho owned and had to pay to manage this land; enough to cover the costs of timber mgmt., recreation and road maintenance, or fire protection – which in 2015 alone cost over $300 million (70% of which the federal government paid).  Imagine Idaho being responsible for that entire $300 million.</li>
                  <li>  The Republican political stranglehold on Idaho is also giving away access to our public lands to Texas gas companies and giving away mineral rights of private landholders by passing laws written by the gas industry lobbyists, using ‘forced-pooling’ to steal resources and our property rights!</li>
                  <li>  Republicans are repealing laws that make our rivers save for fishing, for drinking water, and creating laws that put our ground water at risk.</li>
              <br/>
             <p> Private Lands - We must also protect private ownership rights - Our Idaho legislature is giving Alta-Mesa a free ‘fracking’ license to take our privately held mineral rights to our own land, using 'forced pooling' to force land owners into leases that are only paying a pittance, and no protection when the land or groundwater for wells are poisoned by the chemicals released.</p>
              <div>
                <p> > Since fracking - Oklahoma has more than 3 times the earthquakes as California.</li>

                <p>Educated citizens are one of our most valuable assets! I will work to reform legislative support of education to focus on the children, from Pre-K to preparing students for careers, whether a vocational certification or 2 or 4Year college degree. Build relevant curriculum with input from industry leaders. Make college free through revenue neutral tax deductions, incentives and reforms for business and industry. Require graduates to perform community service ‘pay-back’. Unleash tremendous economic activity by eliminating student debt. Our children are an as yet untapped intellectual resource and could do so much more if only provided with the tools for success - Imagine what all our children could do if educated to their potential.  Education is an investment in the future of our children, an essential investment our nation’s future, and the key to our long-term economic success, growth and security.</p>

                    <li>"..to 12-Prep"; We currently prepare ALL high school kids for a 4-year college education, and provide little to no support for any job or educational choices in between. Not all of our kids are college bound, yet our current system knows no other goal except to push all our children toward college - and that pressure makes them feel somehow less of a person because many just know that college is not for them! Yet All these children still have tremendous potential if only they were able to pursue an education that fits 'their' abilities. Many of our children want and are best suited for something other than a 4-year college degree, so under my 'Scholar-Quest' program, our children have a choice! </li>
                    <li>Starting from 10th grade, "12-Prep" will offer students preparatory alternatives for the many vocational, 2-year and 4-year degree programs and career choices, feeding them into the Scholar-Quest Program.</li>
                    <li>The total existing student debt is greater than all the credit card debt in America! We must make sure students aren't starting their lives under the crushing burden of debt.</li>

                <p> Think of taxes like your income and the Federal budget like your household budget; You have more and more bills and you're in debt up to your eyeballs - So do you run to your boss and say 'I want a pay-cut'?! This is what many in our Congress are trying to do - cut tax revenue when we are already beyond seriously in debt up to our country's eyeballs! This is sound tax policy nor good for our economy - it's just crazy!</p>
                <p> Taxes should be for providing essential services and stimulating growth. No business or country can grow without investing in itself in ways that help it's people be productive, facilitate growth in business, and with more emphasis on education, creating a more able workforce. Investment in more forward-thinking infrastructure projects that create an actual return on our investment, creating more jobs and facilitating future job market expansion. This approach increases the number of businesses and citizens working and paying taxes, and that increase in tax revenue means we can balance the budget with a surplus, create a contingency reserve, and pay down our national debt!</p>
                <p> I will also do everything I can to ensure that there is no misuse of your tax dollars.  As with the recent personal travel scandals that are apparently costing us tax payers into the millions of dollars now, rules and laws should be enforced, these people should be fired and made to pay back every misused tax dollar.</p>

                <p>Contrary to what we've been hearing about Social Security, there is time to evaluate and see what might need to be fixed. We have had some challenges to the system; high unemployment and lower wages resulting in less and lower contributions, Trillions of our dollars being 'borrowed' by the Republican congress and being spent on the general budget of the U.S. - the same general budget that  Ryan Zinke and Tom Price use for their hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal/private travel.</p>
             <p> The only immediate crisis for Social Security is that the Republican legislature wants us to think there is a crisis, and use that scare tactic to take it away from us! As employment and wages increase, and the economy grows stronger, more people will be paying more money into the system, and of course we get congress to honor and pay back their IOU's, and this alleged crisis can be calmly evaluated and any necessary fixes considered. </p>

                <p>It's time to increase investment in Solar and Wind energy, especially because they are free. Not only is it cheap, safe and won't run out, but it also creates good-paying jobs here in Idaho. And it just makes sound business sense! Idaho can become an energy independent state, an energy exporting state, and the first state to reduce energy cost while protecting our environment!</p>

                <p> Solar (PV) panels installed on homes are now lasting over 20 years, and the average recapture of those costs, after tax credit incentives, is about 7 to 9 years - it's paid off and the energy you generate is free! The installations are done tying into your local power company, Idaho Power in our case, so from day one, once the system is approved and installed, you are then able to obtain offsets through 'net metering'.  Basically, that means if you produce more energy than you use, you are off the grid and get energy credits for any excess that your systems put into the grid - which you can use later at no cost. And on the days when you produce less than you use, Idaho Power supplements the difference. Much of the savings starts right away. This net metering tariff is also available for wind, hydro, biomass, geothermal and fuel cell technologies. </p>
            <p> Many cities and towns across the country are converting their municipal energy requirements to some combination of Wind/Solar and other sources, and are cutting their power bills dramatically! Whether you support this because of your love of the environment or your love of money - or both - it is a very sound investment for our state, or country, and you.  And there is the 3rd reason I'm particularly fond of it; eventual energy/political independence from foreign energy sources.

               These kids were raised here in America, America is all they know or remember, and they are all contributing to America. They learn, they work, pay taxes and contribute to America, and many are serving in our military. And all DACA children have gone through an in depth vetting process before qualifying. I will work to make DACA an actual law with a path to citizenship, so these kids can be protected from and not subject to the whims of any executive in the White House.</p>

                <p> We must find a way to reverse the 'Citizens United' decision! Citizen United unfortunately allows unlimited amounts of money from unknown contributors to be used in our elections. Now think about that - unknown contributors could be anyone, including foreign interests, and large corporations that are only looking out for 'their' interests, not those of the average working person. Currently, SuperPACs are formed and the 'unknowns' spend unlimited amounts of money for the purpose of effecting elections through negative and deceptive advertising. In order for our elections to truly be fair, and for the average American citizen's voice to be heard, this must stop!</p>

              <p>In 2010, the Supreme Court, in a 5 to 4 decision, decided that 'money is free speech', super PACs were formed, and in six short years, we now have a Congress that is more interested in corporations and 'Party' than people, and a President named Trump...  If monetary contributions are free speech, considering the spending power of the Koch brothers and those other wealthy corporations that contribute many millions to Super PACs - do you, the average voter, still have the ability to compete? Do you have the same equal influence as the Koch brothers? Or has this caused the 'playing field' to become so un-level that our voices may never be heard? </p>

                <p>Invest in a "Path to Work". We will help the unemployed and those on public assistance by providing education, job training, and placement to help them achieve financial independence. The system is clearly broken and unfortunately misguided efforts to save money trap people on welfare. These folks just need help to be productive, and providing the education and tools necessary for their success save us all money in the long run, and creates productive tax-paying citizens.</p>

                <p>I am a Christian and actually am personally "pro-life". That is my choice. As a Christian, I respect the bible, specifically Matthew 7, "Judge not, lest ye be judged.", so I firmly believe it is not for me to judge the choices of others - it is between them and God.</p>

                <p>Raul Labrador, Russ Fulcher and those who share their political beliefs are actually 'pro-birth', NOT 'pro-life', and have also said that 'healthcare is not a right'...! So using this logic, once born, the mother knows that she and her child are on their own! Knowing the economic hardship she would face, don't the 'pro-birth' people understand that they are actually forcing women to make unwanted choices? Shouldn't being 'Pro-Life' mean that you want create an environment where children and families can thrive? </p>
