              <p>We ALL have a right to affordable and cost-effective healthcare - it can be a reality. We can strengthen and expand Medicare while lowering costs. We will stabilize the market by fixing the current law, have Congress pay pay what they promised, then reduce more costs by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and other services. </p>

                  <li>End legislative sabotage of the ACA</li>
                </ul>
              <p>Creating an American version of "universal healthcare" starting with Medicare as the perfect tool to model, and creating what I am calling "Consolidated-Medicare", will make it work for all of us. This approach is far more affordable for all, including the taxpayers, and shows that cost-effective healthcare can be a reality. Don’t be fooled or believe the lies of those who think we're copying other countries or that don’t believe healthcare is a right; using "Consolidated-Medicare" as a Single Payer/Universal "type of" Healthcare is and will be uniquely American, is an essential investment in our infrastructure, in our economy, our middle-class and an ideal solution for lowering costs and taxes!<p>
              <p>Medicare is very functional, affordable, respected, and creating "Consolidated-Medicare" makes it work for all of us.</p>

              <p>Idaho is NOT for sale! Keep public lands public and protected, accessible for hunting, recreation, and your enjoyment. Idaho cannot afford to maintain & protect these these lands and would have to sell them - then they would be inaccessible & gone forever - We cannot let this happen! </p>

                <p>Republicans try to convince us our federal public lands are a "states rights" issue, and that we need to return them to state control – this makes NO sense! Why take on this additional cost and responsibility when the federal government is paying a bill Idaho can’t afford?</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The Federal government owns and pay to manage 32,621,631 acres in Idaho, which is 61.6% of land in the state, caring for the land that we enjoy.</li>
                  <li>A recent study reveals Idaho would experience up to a $250 million deficit if Idaho owned and had to pay to manage this land; enough to cover the costs of timber mgmt., recreation and road maintenance, or fire protection – which in 2015 alone cost over $300 million, 70% of which the federal government paid. Imagine Idaho being responsible for that entire $300 million.</li>
                  <li>The Republican political stranglehold on Idaho is also giving away access to our public lands to Texas gas companies and giving away mineral rights of private landholders by passing laws written by the gas industry lobbyists, using "forced-pooling" to steal resources and our property rights!</li>
                  <li>Republicans are repealing laws that make our rivers save for fishing, for drinking water, and creating laws that put our ground water at risk.</li>
