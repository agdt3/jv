              <h1 class="title is-1">Healthcare</h1>
              <p>Healthcare is not just sound fiscal policy, but is also a question of our humanity! We ALL have a right to affordable healthcare and my plan shows how cost-effective healthcare can be a reality.  Single Payer/Universal Healthcare is an essential investment in our infrastructure, economy, and lowering taxes.</p>

              <p>Idaho is NOT for sale! I will fight to keep public lands public and accessible, protect all your land rights and keep private lands private.</p>

            <article>
              <h1 class="title is-1">Jobs and Employment</h1>
              <p>I plan to create affordable jobs using targeted infrastructure, education, job training, and tax relief plans that both stimulate and grow the economy! I plan to create jobs that actually pay wages that allow you to afford to be self-sufficient, through education, specialize or vocational job training, tax incentives to business, and rationally applied changes to the minimum wage based upon regional cost of living indexes.</p>

            <article>
              <h1 class="title is-1">Taxes</h1>
              <p>My goal is to cut waste and eliminate any un-necessary taxes by investing in infrastructure projects that create actual return on investment, increasing our tax revenue by creating more affordable jobs, balance the budget with a reserve, and pay down our national debt.</p>

              <h1 class="title is-1">Welfare</h1>
              <p>The system is clearly broken and most of these folks just need help to be productive.  Providing the education and tools for success save us money in the long run, and create productive tax-paying citizens.</p>

              <h1 class="title is-1">Abortion</h1>
              <p>I am a Christian and actually am personally "pro-life". That is my choice. As a Christian, I respect the bible, specifically Matthew 7, "Judge not, that ye be not judged.", so I firmly believe it is not for me to judge the choices of others - it is between them and God.</p>
