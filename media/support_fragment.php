  <p><strong>Friends,</strong></p>
  <br/>
  <p><strong>I am fighting to move Idaho, and our nation forward, no matter how powerful the folks standing in our way.</strong></p>
   <br>
  <ul>
    <li>The Republicans are well funded and we aren’t!</li>
    <li>The Republicans are in office, and we aren’t!</li>
    <li>The Republicans will stay in office, unless...!</li>
  </ul><br>
<p> ...unless; we all come together, put our differences aside, unite, work hard for what we believe in, and contribute what you can to help our campaign succeed!</p><br>
<p>We cannot continue to elect the few who think only of themselves and are not properly representing Idaho, or you!  I firmly believe that America is ready for representatives that are one of them; that listen to the people and put them first, that understand <i>our</i> lives, and that have lived in tough times and had to work hard on their way to a better life.</p><br>
<p> I’m running now because I can’t stand to see anyone try to make it even harder to have a 'better life', or take away what we've worked so hard for. With so much on the line, we have to unite and stand together. I need your help to ensure that ALL our voices are heard, and that I can speak for you!   I also don't want your 'one-time' donation to hurt, so see what you can afford monthly and consider a recurring donation.  In these times, it is truly an investment in protecting our future! </p><br>
<p>Please, <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/jamesvandermaas" target="_blank"><strong>donate now</strong></a> and let’s make sure our voices are heard! <i>–Jim</i></p>
